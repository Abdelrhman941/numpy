### 📌 NumPy Overview

✅ **NumPy** is a **third-party Python module** designed to work with **arrays** and **matrices**.  
✅ **NumPy** stands for **Numerical Python**.  
✅ It is **open-source** and widely used in **scientific computing**.  
✅ It supports **large multidimensional arrays & matrices**.  
✅ NumPy provides **many mathematical functions** to efficiently manipulate these elements.  

#### 💡 **NumPy is an essential library for data science, machine learning, and numerical computing! 🚀**

### ✨ Why Use NumPy Arrays?

🔹 **Consumes Less Memory**  
🔹 **Much Faster** compared to Python lists  
🔹 **Easy to Use**  
🔹 **Supports Element-Wise Operations**  
🔹 **Elements Are Stored Contiguously in Memory**

### 📌 Python Lists vs. NumPy Arrays  

#### **Python Lists**  
✔️ **Homogeneous** → Can contain the **same type** of objects.  
✔️ **Heterogeneous** → Can contain **different types** of objects.  

#### **NumPy Arrays**  
🔹 **All elements must be of the same type**.  
🔹 **More memory-efficient** → You can be sure about the **storage size** required.  
🔹 **Indexed from 0** (just like Python lists).
